This repository contains builds of the Gleam programming language for alternative operating systems and architectures not officially supported by the project.

Please note all OpenBSD releases for SPARC64 use GCC 8, as found in the SPARC64 ports tree.
OmniOS builds use whatever /usr/bin/gcc points to for that release.
